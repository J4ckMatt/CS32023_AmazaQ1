            <p>
                <span class = "bold">JMatt’s Fisheries</span> is a site where you and I, together, can learn how to prepare a few fish-based Filipino meals.  
                These meals range from <span class = "italic">Pinirito(fried fish), Sinugba(grilled), Adobo, Tinola, to Sinigang na isda!</span> 
                Our purpose is to provide necessary information, including the skills it takes in cooking fish, for people who seek 
                to learn how to. We believe that knowledge is for everyone, especially when it comes to cooking 
                because it serves as an essential life skill that each of us must possess as members of the society. 
                We aim to support users to view our website with the best possible comfort they deserve. That is why we contain 
                special add-ons such as our <a class = "Paragraph-Links" href = "#">FAQ page</a> where you, users, can visit the different 
                feedbacks and questions based of off previous experiences. In case you experience more relevant and more serious issues, 
                we have our <a class = "Paragraph-Links" href = "#">Contact and Support page</a> which contains a list of our emails and mobile numbers 
                that enables you to directly contact and report to us in times of need. Lastly, see a brief outline of our website,

            <h3>Content Page:</h3>

            <p class = "Content_Intro">
                In the <span class = "bold"><a class = "Paragraph-Links" href = "#">content section</a></span>, we will be showing you how these meals are prepared. 
            The preparation of each meal consists of <span class = "italic">Three Phases. </span>
            </p>
            <p class = "Content_First_Phase">
                For the <span class = "italic">First phase,</span> we will be displaying the list of materials, and different ingredients 
            needed for cooking. There is no need to worry, however, with the utensils and ingredients needed because we make sure that 
            all materials are easy to get and can be found right at home.
            </p>
            <p class = "Content_Second_Phase">
                For the <span class = "italic">Second phase,</span> we move on and proceed to the step-by-step process in making the actual meal. 
            Before starting, we must ensure the user has a nice setting where they would be cooking the meals. This is then followed with the 
            procedures when cooking the desired meal. Right after, comes the cleaning part which includes the storage and sanitization of 
            utensils right after use. And after all of that, we can now enjoy our meal!
            </p>
            <p class = "Content_Third_Phase">
                The <span class = "italic">Third and Last phase</span> is found at the bottom of each page of the content. 
            This is where I would provide my personal evaluations and thoughts on each meal. This includes my personal experience and 
            ratings on each of the fish-based meals presented.
            </p>
